# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning (Part of internship at Microsoft and Edunet Foundation)

This project uses machine learning models to predict the **next day's temperature** based on historical weather data. It includes feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts next-day temperature using past trends
- Trains and compares multiple models:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Linear Regression
- Uses features like:
  - Previous temperature
  - Day, Month, Day of Week
  - Temperature differences and rolling statistics
  - Season identification
- Generates multiple graphs:
  - Actual vs Predicted temperature plots
  - Feature correlation heatmap
  - Target temperature distribution
- Displays evaluation metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score (variance explained)
